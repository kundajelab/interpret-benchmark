1-GCCCTCTAGTGG
3-GTYCAAAGTYCA
1-DGTAAACA
6-TGACCTTGAC
6-TTAATNATTAAC
7-WAGCCCCGCCCH; Sp1, is expressed in HepG2
8-NNNNTTCCGV; Elk1 (Diseases associated with ELK1 include Hepatocellular Carcinoma)
#11-GCGCGCTA; top hit was DPL-1(E2F)/cElegans-Adult-ChIP-Seq(modEncode)/Homer, followed by 2 yeast motifs. None of the human motifs seemed like great fits.  Probably a GC artifact.
#12-AAACAAAGCG; top hit is pan/MA0237.2/Jaspar. Looks like a degenerate motif, matches to a bunch of non-human stuff.
#11-ACTACAATTCCC; dropping because it's present in <1% of positives
14-TRCGCATGCG; NRF1, which is chipped in HepG2
12-GGCCGCCATCTT; YY1, which is chipped in HepG2
16-BRTTGCGCAA; CEBPE, which is chipped in HepG2
17-CGGCCAATCG; NFY (NFY transcription factor binds to regulatory element AIC and transactivates the human apolipoprotein A-I promoter in HEPG2 cells)
18-TCTCGCGA; ZBTB33 (which is chipped in HepG2) 
22-GATGACTCAY; FOSL2 (which is chipped in HepG2)
19-GTCACGTGACGC; E-box motif, so I'm keeping it
#20-RTTCGAACCCGC; very degenerate, top hits are yeast, and present in only 0.06% of positives...
#21-NMGTKACGTMNN; very degenerate, present in only 0.59% of motifs
#23-CGTCGCCCGAAA; quite degenerate, top hit was Mad/dmmpmm(Pollard)/fly(0.670)
#25-ATGTRCCGTATA; present in only 0.04% of positives, top hit was Cf2-II/dmmpmm(Pollard)/fly(0.584)
