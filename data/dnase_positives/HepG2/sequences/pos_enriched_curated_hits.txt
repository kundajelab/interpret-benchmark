7-WAGCCCCGCCCH; Sp1, is expressed in HepG2
8-NNNNTTCCGV; Elk1 (Diseases associated with ELK1 include Hepatocellular Carcinoma)
11-GCGCGCTA; top hit was DPL-1(E2F)/cElegans-Adult-ChIP-Seq(modEncode)/Homer. But E2F is probably real.
#12-AAACAAAGCG; all < 0.7 match to a known motif. Top hit is pan/MA0237.2/Jaspar. Looks like a degenerate motif, matches to a bunch of non-human stuff.
11-ACTACAATTCCC; GFY(?) - is in the HOMER database
14-TRCGCATGCG; NRF1, which is chipped in HepG2
12-GGCCGCCATCTT; YY1, which is chipped in HepG2
16-BRTTGCGCAA; CEBPE, which is chipped in HepG2
17-CGGCCAATCG; NFY (NFY transcription factor binds to regulatory element AIC and transactivates the human apolipoprotein A-I promoter in HEPG2 cells)
18-TCTCGCGA; ZBTB33 (which is chipped in HepG2) 
22-GATGACTCAY; FOSL2 (which is chipped in HepG2)
19-GTCACGTGACGC; E-box motif, so I'll keep it
#20-RTTCGAACCCGC; top hits are yeast, and present in only 0.06% of positives...
21-NMGTKACGTMNN; Atf-1, which is chipped in HepG2
#23-CGTCGCCCGAAA; suspicious-looking, present in 0.04% pos, top hit was Mad/dmmpmm(Pollard)/fly(0.670)
